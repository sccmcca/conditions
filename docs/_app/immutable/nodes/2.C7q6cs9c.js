By studying formal and material conditions, this thesis will engage directly with contingent urban context through observation, documentation, and interpretive making to examine how the overlooked artifacts of everyday life are the result of informal participation in the production of space and contemporary design culture.<br/><br/> This thesis foregrounds adaptive reuse and economies of construction, treating discarded, provisional, and improvised material conditions as resources for contextual architectural invention. Drawing on discourses of semiology, contemporary material culture, deconstructivism, and spatial production, the research proposes techniques of observation and making that highlight chance encounters, circumstantial geometries, and the aesthetics of contemporaneity as a productive force in design.<br/><br/> Warmly,<br/> <span class="blur svelte-1uha8ag"><em>Scott Christian McCallum</em></span></p></div> <div class="gallery single-column svelte-1uha8ag"></div></div></main>');function E(u,r){b(r,!1);let n=A(r,"data",8);T();var e=j(),c=o(e),l=_(o(c),2);x(l,5,()=>(w(n()),d(()=>n().imgDipList)),C,(v,t)=>{var i=M(),m=o(i);a(i),k(f=>{h(m,"src",`${D}${s(t)}`),h(m,"alt",f)},[()=>(s(t),d(()=>s(t).split("/").pop()))]),p(v,i)}),a(l),a(c),a(e),p(u,e),y()}export{E as component};
